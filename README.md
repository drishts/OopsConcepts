**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Detail**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that contain both data and behavior. OOP helps in structuring software in a modular and reusable manner.

The four fundamental OOP concepts are:

Encapsulation

Abstraction

Inheritance

Polymorphism

1. Encapsulation
Definition:
Encapsulation is the process of binding data (variables) and methods (functions) together within a single unit (class). It restricts direct access to certain details of an object and only allows access through controlled methods.

Key Benefits:
Protects data from direct modification.

Ensures data integrity and security.

Improves code maintainability and flexibility.

Technical Questions on Encapsulation
Why do we use private variables in encapsulation?
Answer: To prevent direct access and modification of data, ensuring data security and integrity.

How does encapsulation improve code maintainability?
Answer: It hides implementation details and exposes only necessary functionalities, making changes easier without affecting other parts of the program.

What is the difference between encapsulation and data hiding?
Answer: Encapsulation is the overall concept of bundling data and methods, whereas data hiding specifically refers to restricting direct access to data using access modifiers like private.

Can encapsulation be achieved without private variables?
Answer: Yes, by using getter and setter methods with appropriate access modifiers like protected or public, although private variables are the most common way to enforce data hiding.

2. Abstraction
Definition:
Abstraction is the concept of hiding implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object. It allows users to interact with the functionality without worrying about the underlying complexity.

Key Benefits:
Reduces complexity and enhances readability.

Improves maintainability and flexibility.

Provides a clear separation between what an object does and how it does it.

Technical Questions on Abstraction
What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?
Answer: Encapsulation focuses on hiding the internal details of an object by bundling data and methods, while abstraction hides the implementation details and only exposes essential features.

How can abstraction be implemented in Java?
Answer: It can be implemented using abstract classes and interfaces, which define methods without providing their implementations.

Can an abstract class have a constructor?
Answer: Yes, an abstract class can have a constructor, which is executed when a subclass is instantiated.

Why can’t we create objects of an abstract class?
Answer: Abstract classes are meant to be incomplete templates and require subclasses to provide concrete implementations.

3. Inheritance
Definition:
Inheritance is a mechanism where one class (child class) derives properties and behaviors from another class (parent class). It promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between classes.

Key Benefits:
Eliminates code duplication.

Improves code organization and hierarchy.

Facilitates polymorphism through method overriding.

Types of Inheritance in Java:
Single Inheritance – One class inherits from another.

Multilevel Inheritance – A child class inherits from another child class.

Hierarchical Inheritance – Multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class.

Hybrid Inheritance – Combination of multiple inheritance types (achievable using interfaces).

Multiple Inheritance – Not supported using classes in Java, but achievable using interfaces.

Technical Questions on Inheritance
Can a subclass inherit private members from a parent class?
Answer: No, private members are not inherited, but they can be accessed through public or protected methods in the parent class.

What is the role of the super keyword in inheritance?
Answer: The super keyword is used to call parent class methods and constructors from a child class.

Why does Java not support multiple inheritance with classes?
Answer: To avoid ambiguity and complexity caused by the Diamond Problem, Java allows multiple inheritance only through interfaces.

What is method overriding in inheritance?
Answer: Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class, enabling runtime polymorphism.

4. Polymorphism
Definition:
Polymorphism allows objects to take multiple forms, meaning a single interface can be used for different implementations. It enables flexibility and extensibility in programs.

Types of Polymorphism:
Compile-time Polymorphism (Method Overloading) – When multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters.

Runtime Polymorphism (Method Overriding) – When a subclass provides a different implementation of a method that exists in its parent class.

Key Benefits:
Improves code flexibility and scalability.

Supports dynamic behavior at runtime.

Enhances code readability and reusability.

Technical Questions on Polymorphism
What is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?
Answer:

Method Overloading: Same method name, different parameters, resolved at compile-time.

Method Overriding: Same method signature, different implementations in parent and child classes, resolved at runtime.

Can we overload the main method in Java?
Answer: Yes, we can overload the main method, but the JVM will always call public static void main(String[] args) as the entry point.

Can a constructor be overridden in Java?
Answer: No, constructors cannot be overridden, but they can be overloaded with different parameters.

How does Java achieve runtime polymorphism?
Answer: Java achieves runtime polymorphism through method overriding and dynamic method dispatch, where the method call is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.
